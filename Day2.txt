Q1.List 5 difference between Browser JS(console) v Nodejs
   Node js :
   1.Node doesn’t have a predefined “window” object cause it doesn’t have a window to draw anything.
   2.“location” object is related to a particular url; that means it is for page specific. So, node doesn’t require that.
   3.Ofcourse Node doesn’t have “document” object also, cause it never have to render anything in a page.
   4.Node has “global”, which is a predefined global object. It contains several functions that are not available in browsers, cause they are needed for server side works only.
   5.“require” object is predefined in Node which is used to include modules in the app.
      In Node everything is a module. You must keep your code inside a module.
   Browser js(Console) :
   1.“window” is a predefined global object which has functions and attributes, that have to deal with window that has been drawn.
   2.“location” is another predefined object in browsers, that has all the information about the url we have loaded.
   3.“document”, which is also another predefined global variable in browsers, has the html which is rendered.
   4.Browsers may have an object named “global”, but it will be the exact one as “window”.
   5.Browsers don’t have “require” predefined. You may include it in your app for asynchronous file loading.
     Moduling is not mandatory in client side JavaScript, i.e. in browsers.

Q2.Watch & summary 5 points -So how does the browser actually render a website
   1.Arrangement of header,body,paragraph,etc called HTML parsing to ctrate DOM tree.
     Parsing-->DOM tree
   2.Adding style,colour to the elements of HTML called CSSOM tree.And combining DOM & CSSOM tree to create Render tree.
     DOM(JS)-->
               -->Render tree
     CSS    -->
   3.Render tree consist of
     render object
     render style
     render layers
     line boxes
   4.Layout computes where a node will be on sceen.
   5.Painting computes bitmap and composites to screen.

Q4.Execute the below code and write your description in txt file
   a.typeof(1)//number
   b.typeof(1.1)//number
   c.typeof('1.1')//string
   d.typeof(true)//boolean
   e.typeof(null)//object
   f.typeof(undefined)//undefined
   h.typeof([])//object
   i.typeof({})//object
   j.typeof(NaN)//number
